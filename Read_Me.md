# Code Challenge Solutions

This repository contains Python modules that provide solutions to various coding challenges. Each module is designed to address a specific challenge. Below are detailed descriptions of each module, along with instructions on how to use them effectively.

## Requirements

* **Python 3.10 and above**
* **Visual Studio Code or any other IDE**

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the repository directory in your preferred IDE.
3. To run a module, open a terminal within your IDE and type:
   python module_name
         or
   python3 module_name
where `module_name` is the name of the module you want to run.
4. Alternatively, you can simply press the "Run" button in your IDE to execute the modules.

## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour Time to 24-hour Time

Module: `challenge_1.py`

This module provides a function that converts a 12-hour time format (with hour, minute, and period) to a 24-hour time format. It takes user input for the hour, minute, and period (am/pm) and returns the corresponding time in 24-hour format.

### Usage

1. Run the `challenge_1.py` module.
2. Follow the prompts to input the hour, minute, and period (am/pm).
3. The module will display the corresponding 24-hour time.

## Challenge 2: Identifying Two Positive Numbers

Module: `challenge_2.py`

This module contains a function that determines whether exactly two out of three integers are positive. It takes three integers as input and returns `True` if exactly two of them are positive; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Usage

1. Run the `challenge_2.py` module.
2. Follow the prompts to input three integers.
3. The module will display whether exactly two of the input integers are positive.

## Challenge 3: Calculating Highest Value of Consonant Substrings

Module: `challenge_3.py`

This module defines a function that calculates the highest value of consonant substrings in a given word or sentence. It ensures the input only contains letters, not just vowels, and is not empty or composed solely of spaces.

### Usage

1. Run the `challenge_3.py` module.
2. Input a word or sentence containing alphabetic characters.
3. The module will calculate the highest value of consonant substrings and display the result.
