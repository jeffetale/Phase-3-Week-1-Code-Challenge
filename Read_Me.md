# Code Challenge Solutions

This repository contains Python modules that solve various coding challenges. Each module is designed to tackle a specific challenge. Below are the descriptions of each module along with instructions on how to use them.

## Requirements

* python3.10 and above
* Visual Studio Code or any othe IDE

To use, clone this repository to your machine and open the directory.
To run a module type [python module_name] or [python3 module_name] where "module name" is the name of the module you want to run.
Or you can simply press the run button in your IDE to run the modules.

## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour Time to 24-hour Time

Module: `challenge_1.py`

This module provides a function that converts a 12-hour time format (with hour, minute, and period) to a 24-hour time format. It takes user input for the hour, minute, and period (am/pm) and returns the corresponding time in 24-hour format.

### Usage

1. Run the `challenge_1.py` module.
2. Follow the prompts to input the hour, minute, and period (am/pm).
3. The module will display the corresponding 24-hour time.

## Challenge 2: Identifying Two Positive Numbers

Module: `challenge_2.py`

This module contains a function that determines whether exactly two out of three integers are positive. It takes three integers as input and returns `True` if exactly two of them are positive; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Usage

1. Run the `challenge_2.py` module.
2. Follow the prompts to input three integers.
3. The module will display whether exactly two of the input integers are positive.

## Challenge 3: Calculating Highest Value of Consonant Substrings

Module: `challenge_3.py`

This module defines a function that calculates the highest value of consonant substrings in a given word or sentence. It ensures the input only contains letters, not just vowels, and is not empty or composed solely of spaces.

### Usage

1. Run the `challenge_3.py` module.
2. Input a word or sentence containing alphabetic characters.
3. The module will calculate the highest value of consonant substrings and display the result.
